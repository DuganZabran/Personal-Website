          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Hello! My name is Dugan Zabran, and I'm a cybersecurity professional with a passion for exploring the latest trends and techniques in the field. This website is a showcase of my personal projects and work in the cybersecurity space, and I hope it provides visitors with valuable insights into my skills and experiences.</p>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I earned my degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from Northern Illinois University, where I gained a solid foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of computing. Since then, I've had the privilege of completing internships at Abbott, CME Group, and Schonfeld, where I eventually landed a full-time role as a cybersecurity analyst. In my current position, I've focused on honing my skills in areas such as risk management, vulnerability assessments, and incident response. However, my true passion lies in areas like penetration testing and application security, where I can really sink my teeth into the nitty-gritty details of cybersecurity. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow my skillset, and I'm excited to see where my journey in the world of cybersecurity will take me next.</p>
          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <p>In my free time, I enjoy fencing and cooking. As a former captain of my university's fencing team, I have a deep love and appreciation for the sport, and I still enjoy practicing my skills whenever I get the chance. I also love experimenting with new recipes and flavors in the kitchen, and find cooking to be a fun and creative outlet. Whether I'm wielding a foil or a spatula, I always strive to bring a combination of discipline, skill, and passion to everything I do. Test 8</p>
